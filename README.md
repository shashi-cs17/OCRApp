### Aim:

 

Official letters and documents play an important role in the overall functioning of the any organization. But often, due to being in such a large number and being forwarded in a hierarchal manner, managing these documents and letters becomes a very complex process.

 

Hence a simple but effective approach is required for saving these documents without much effort which will also be helpful in recovering a saved document when it gets damaged or lost.
